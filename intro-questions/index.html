			<b>i.</b> derrek wang | comdes major, compsci minor | sophomore
			<br><br>
			<b>ii.</b> i'm very interested in combining art and computer science, so here i am!
			<br><br>
			<b>iii.</b> i edited an existing tumblr theme once. it was very simple, just editing a few variables and adding an extra element in the form of a "next page" button. html syntax isn't completely foreign to me, but building something from scratch is.
			<br><br>
			<b>iv.</b> i would hope to learn methods for user interaction beyond simple buttons and menus.
			<br><br>
			<b>v.</b> i imagine that moving beyond the urge to make tiny 2-pixel adjustments will be quite a challenge, whereas with paper its easier to see the big picture because these tiny adjustments are harder to make.
			<br><br>
			<b>vi.</b> <a href="kickstarter.com">kickstarter</a> recently overhauled their website, and i think it looks beautiful. clean and minimalistic, but with enough of a personality to keep it interesting.
			<br><br>
			<b>vii.</b> <a href="wikipedia.org">wikipedia.</a> every page is structured in such a way that all the information is no more than one link away, which facilitates communication effectively.
			<br><br>
			<b>viii.</b> <a href="craigslist.org">craigslist.</a> no frills, no fuss. it does exactly what it needs to, and while it doesn't look pretty, it works every time.
